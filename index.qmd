Welcome to the Time Series Forecasting course at ITESO. Here you will find all the materials and resources needed for the course.

# Time Series Forecasting with R

Modern forecasting workflows using **tidy data principles** with the **tidyverts** ecosystem.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

## What you’ll learn

- Build tidy time series with **tsibble** and modern data pipelines
- Create forecasts with **ETS**, **ARIMA**, and regression-based models via **fable**
- Engineer time features and diagnose models with **feasts**
- Evaluate with time-aware resampling and communicate uncertainty
- Scale to multiple series and hierarchies when needed

::: {.callout-tip}
## How to succeed here
Forecasting improves with *iteration*: start simple, validate honestly, and refine. Keep a tight loop of **fit → diagnose → evaluate → communicate**.

## Course map

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

### 1. Foundations
- tidy data + time indexes
- `tsibble` keys, gaps, and intervals

### 2. Patterns & features
- seasonality, trend, decomposition
- diagnostics and features (`feasts`)

:::
::: {.column}

### 3. Core forecasting models
- ETS + ARIMA
- model comparison and selection

### 4. Regression workflows
- time features, events, and covariates
- forecast reconciliation ideas

:::
::: {.column}

### 5. Evaluation & communication
- time series CV and backtesting
- uncertainty, intervals, and narratives

### 6. Multiple series
- grouped models
- hierarchies and reconciliation

## Quick setup check

Run this once after installing packages to confirm your environment.

```{r}
#| label: setup-check
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tsibble)
library(fable)
library(feasts)

sessionInfo()
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Common pitfalls
- **Data leakage**: don’t let future information sneak into features.
- **Random CV**: use **time-aware** resampling/backtesting.
- **Overfitting**: a more complex model isn’t automatically better.
:::

---

## Primary toolchain

We’ll use a tidy workflow centered on:

- **tidyverse** for data wrangling
- **tsibble** for time-aware tibbles
- **fable** for modeling and forecasting
- **feasts** for decomposition, features, and diagnostics

# Time Series Forecasting with R

**Goal:** build forecasting workflows using **tidyverts** (tsibble + fable + feasts).

---

## What you’ll learn

- Tidy time series data with **tsibble**
- Forecast with **ETS / ARIMA / regression** using **fable**
- Diagnose and engineer features with **feasts**
- Evaluate with **time-aware** resampling
- Communicate uncertainty clearly

## Navigation

- Setup: `setup.qmd`
- Syllabus: `syllabus.qmd`
- Modules: `modules/index.qmd`
- Assignments: `assignments/index.qmd`
- Resources: `resources.qmd`

## Workflow mantra

**fit → diagnose → evaluate → communicate**

::: {.callout-warning}
Avoid: leakage • random CV • unnecessary complexity

## Suggestions & Improvements

- Add a small **module timeline** graphic or table (weeks → topics → deliverables) for faster orientation.
- Consider a short “**What you need before starting**” checklist (prereqs + expected weekly time).
- If you use one core dataset repeatedly, feature it here to create continuity across modules.
