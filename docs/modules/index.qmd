Welcome to the **Modules** section of the course. Each module is a short, guided sequence of lessons with examples and practice opportunities.

- **Start here:** [Module 1 — Introduction](module_1/00_intro/intro.qmd)
- Looking for practice? Go to [Exercises](../exercises/index.qmd)

## How to navigate

Use the **Modules** sidebar to move lesson-by-lesson. Each lesson page includes explanations, code, and short checks to make sure ideas stick.

## Prerequisites and setup

A dedicated setup page is coming soon. For now:

- Make sure you can open an `.Rproj`, run an `{r}` code chunk, and install packages in R.
- If something breaks, start with [Module 1 — Introduction](module_1/00_intro/intro.qmd), which includes the course expectations and workflow.

## Course map

### Module 1: Forecasting models based on decomposition methods

You’ll build fundamentals: time series data structures, decomposition, and forecasting principles.

- [1.0 Introduction](module_1/00_intro/intro.qmd)
- [1.1 RStudio, R, and Time Series](module_1/01_time_series/r_time_series.qmd)
- [1.2 Time Series Decomposition](module_1/02_ts_dcmp/ts_dcmp.qmd)
- [1.3 Forecasting principles](module_1/03_fcst/forecasting.qmd)
- [1.4 The Forecasting Workflow](forecasting_workflow.qmd)

**What’s next?** Start with [1.0 Introduction](module_1/00_intro/intro.qmd), then continue in order using the sidebar.

### Module 2: Adding ETS and ARIMA filters

You’ll expand to classical statistical forecasting families and diagnostics.

- [2.1 Exponential Smoothing](module_2/01_ets/ets.qmd)
- [2.2 Identifying Stationarity](module_2/02_stationarity/stationarity.qmd)
- 2.3 ARIMA models *(coming soon)*
- 2.4 Decomposition & ETS/ARIMA *(coming soon)*

**What’s next?** After Module 1, begin with [2.1 Exponential Smoothing](module_2/01_ets/ets.qmd).

### Module 3: Adding exogenous variables to the model

You’ll incorporate external drivers and build stronger, more realistic forecasts.

- [3.1 Linear Regression Models](module_3/01_regression/regression.qmd)
- 3.2 Build dynamic regressions *(coming soon)*
- 3.3 Analyze the model's performance *(coming soon)*
- 3.4 Choose the best variables for the model *(coming soon)*

**What’s next?** When available, start with [3.1 Linear Regression Models](module_3/01_regression/regression.qmd) and follow the sequence.

---

### Module 4: Forecasting at scale

You’ll learn approaches for multiple series, hierarchy, reconciliation, and scalable evaluation.

- 4.1 Understanding the challenges and approaches when dealing with multiple time series *(coming soon)*
- 4.2 Applying hierarchical and reconciliation models *(coming soon)*
- 4.3 Efficient forecasting workflow *(coming soon)*
- 4.4 Evaluation of the global performance *(coming soon)*

**What’s next?** Check back once lessons are published—this module will be best tackled after Modules 1–3.

## Recommended study loop

1. **Read** the lesson (focus on *why* the method works).
2. **Run** the code and check outputs.
3. **Tweak** one assumption (horizon, transformation, features) and observe what changes.
4. **Practice** with the matching exercise set.
