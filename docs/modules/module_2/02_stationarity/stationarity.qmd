- A time series is said to be **stationary** if its statistical properties (mean and variance) are constant over time.
- Stationarity is important because many time series forecasting methods assume that the underlying data is stationary.
- Non-stationary data can lead to inaccurate forecasts and misleading interpretations.
- There are two main types of stationarity:
  - **Strict Stationarity**: The joint distribution of any set of observations is the same regardless of the time at which they are observed.
  - **Weak Stationarity**: The mean, variance, and autocovariance of the series are constant over time.
- In practice, we often focus on weak stationarity because it is easier to test and work with.
