## What this site is

This is the public course hub for **Time Series Forecasting**.

It is intentionally built as a **working reference**:

- lecture notes you can revisit during the semester
- code-first examples you can reuse in projects
- exercises that build muscle memory for real forecasting workflows

::: {.callout-note}
If you only follow one rule: **always compare against a baseline**.
Fancy models without a baseline are just expensive opinions.
:::

## Who it’s for

You’ll do best in this course if you can:

- manipulate data frames confidently (filter, mutate, group_by, join)
- understand basic probability/statistics and linear regression
- stay organized with reproducible work (projects, scripts, reports)

::: {.callout-important}
This course is not “click-and-run forecasting”.
You will be expected to justify assumptions, diagnose models, and communicate tradeoffs.
:::

## How to use the site

Use the navbar as your map:

- **Modules**: the core storyline (what you must learn)
- **Exercises**: practice and feedback loops (what makes it stick)
- **More**: optional refreshers (R tooling, stats, side quests)
- **About**: this page

A practical routine:

1. Read the module page.
2. Run the code (don’t just skim it).
3. Do the exercise.
4. Write a short explanation of what changed and why.

## Tools and conventions

We work primarily in **R**, using the tidy ecosystem for forecasting:

- native pipe `|>` (read it as “then”)
- tidy data + functional pipelines
- forecasting as a workflow: split → fit → evaluate → iterate → communicate

Mathematics is included when it adds clarity, not as decoration.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If you come from Python, you can still follow along.
The mental model matters more than the syntax.
:::

## Elendil TA (AI code assistant)

**Elendil TA** is available from the navbar. Use it to:

- debug errors and understand messages
- translate ideas into R code
- check your reasoning and interpretation

What not to do:

- paste entire assignments and ask for the final answer
- use it as a substitute for understanding your own results

::: {.callout-warning}
If you can’t explain your model, you don’t own it.
Treat AI output as *draft code* that must be validated.
:::

## Feedback, corrections, and reuse

This site is maintained like a small open-source project.

## Credits and inspiration

This course is strongly inspired by [*Forecasting: Principles and Practice (FPP3)*](https://otexts.com/fpp3/) and the broader forecasting community.
