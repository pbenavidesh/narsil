These materials are **optional** and are not required to pass the course.

They are meant to help you:

- Refresh prerequisite concepts (statistics, probability, regression)
- Work more comfortably in R and the tidyverse ecosystem
- Improve your workflow and reproducibility (projects, Quarto, organization)

You are encouraged to use them **as needed**.
