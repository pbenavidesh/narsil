This document is **optional**, but strongly recommended.

If tidyverse pipelines explain *how data flows*, **tsibble** explains *what kind of data you are working with*.  
For time series, this distinction is essential.

---

## Why tsibble exists

Most time series errors come from one simple problem:

> we forget that **time is a structure**, not just a column.

A `tsibble` makes time **explicit**, **checked**, and **enforced**.

Instead of asking:
- “do I have a date column?”

we ask:
- “what defines time in this data?”
- “what uniquely identifies a series?”
- “are observations ordered and regular?”

---

## From tibble to tsibble

A `tsibble` is a tibble with extra rules.

Conceptually:

- a **tibble** is just rows and columns  
- a **tsibble** is:
  - a table of time-indexed observations
  - with an explicit time variable (**index**)
  - and optional identifiers (**keys**)

::: {.callout-note}
A tsibble is still a tibble.  
All tidyverse verbs work the same way.
:::

---

## The two core ideas: index and key

Every tsibble is defined by:

- an **index** → the time variable  
- a **key** → what distinguishes one series from another  

### Index

The index answers:

> “along which variable does time move forward?”

Examples:
- `date`
- `year`
- `yearweek`
- `yearmonth`

### Key

The key answers:

> “what defines a unique time series?”

Examples:

- a store  
- a product  
- a sensor  
- a country  

A dataset can have:
- no key (single series)
- one key
- multiple keys (hierarchical series)

---

## Creating a tsibble

```r
library(tsibble)

data_ts <- data |>
  as_tsibble(
    index = date,
    key = id
  )
```

Reading this with the pipeline mental model:

> take `data`, **then** declare that `date` is time,  
> **then** declare that `id` identifies each series.

::: {.callout-tip}
Always read `as_tsibble()` as a *declaration*, not a transformation.
:::

---

## What tsibble checks for you

When you create a tsibble, R checks that:

- the index is ordered
- each key–index combination is unique
- time moves forward consistently

If something is wrong, **it fails early**.

::: {.callout-warning}
Errors at `as_tsibble()` time are a feature.  
They prevent silent mistakes later in modeling and forecasting.
:::

---

## Regular vs irregular time

Some series have observations at fixed intervals:

- daily
- monthly
- yearly

Others do not.

A tsibble keeps track of this distinction.

```r
is_regular(data_ts)
```

If a series is regular, many models become simpler and more efficient.

::: {.callout-note}
Regularity is a property of the **index**, not the values.
:::

---

## Missing time is different from missing values

A critical distinction in time series:

- missing **values** → `NA`
- missing **time points** → gaps

tsibble makes this difference explicit.

```r
data_ts |>
  has_gaps()
```

To fill missing time points:

```r
data_ts |>
  fill_gaps()
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Do not confuse “no observation” with “observation equals NA”.
:::

---

## tsibble and tidyverse pipelines

Because tsibble extends tibble, pipelines feel natural:

```r
data |>
  as_tsibble(index = date, key = id) |>
  filter(date >= yearmonth("2019 Jan")) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The difference is not syntax — it is **semantics**.

---

## Why models require tsibbles

In tidyverts:

- models expect a clear notion of time
- forecasts depend on index behavior
- keys define independent series

Without a tsibble, the model cannot know:

- what “next” means
- how many steps ahead to forecast
- whether series are independent

::: {.callout-note}
tsibble is the contract between your data and the forecasting models.
:::

---

## Common mistakes

### Forgetting the key

```r
as_tsibble(data, index = date)
```

This creates a **single series**, even if multiple series are present.

### Using the wrong index

Using an identifier as time will often succeed syntactically, but fail conceptually.

::: {.callout-warning}
If your forecasts look strange, always check the index and key first.
:::

---

## How this fits in the course

Throughout the course:

- all time series data will be stored as tsibbles
- models will assume valid indices and keys
- diagnostics rely on tsibble structure

If something breaks early, it usually means the data structure is wrong — not the model.

## Final takeaway

::: {.callout-tip}
If tidyverse pipelines describe **how data changes**,  
tsibbles describe **what kind of time-based data you have**.
:::

Get the structure right, and the models will make sense.
