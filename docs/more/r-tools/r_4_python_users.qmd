This document is **optional**, but highly recommended if you come from a Python background.

The goal is **not** to teach R from scratch.  
The goal is to help you **translate mental models** from Python to R, so that the rest of the course feels natural instead of frustrating.

::: {.callout-note}
If you already feel comfortable with R, you can safely skip this document and come back to it only if something feels confusing later on.

## 1. The main mindset shift

If you come from Python, you are used to thinking in terms of:

- step-by-step instructions  
- objects that are modified in place  
- explicit loops  
- “do this, then do that”

R (especially the tidyverse) encourages a different way of thinking:

- transformations instead of instructions  
- immutable data objects  
- pipelines instead of loops  
- “what happens to the data as it flows”

::: {.callout-tip}
In tidyverse code, try to read pipelines **out loud**.  
If it sounds like a sentence describing the data, you are probably doing it right.
:::

---

## 2. Imperative vs functional style

::: {.tabset group="language"}

### Python

```python
df = df[df["value"] > 0]
df["log_value"] = np.log(df["value"])
df = df.groupby("id").mean()
```

- Each line modifies or reassigns `df`
- State changes over time
- Order matters a lot

### R (tidyverse)

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0) |>
  mutate(log_value = log(value)) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(across(everything(), mean))
```

- Each step returns a new object
- No mutation in place
- The pipeline reads top to bottom

:::

::: {.callout-note}
Think of `|>` as saying:  
“take the result so far, **and then** apply the next transformation”.
:::

## 3. Core object mapping (Python → R)

| Python | R |
|------|---|
| `pandas.DataFrame` | `tibble` |
| `Series` | vector |
| `NaN` | `NA` |
| `df.copy()` | usually unnecessary |
| `for row in df` | avoid |
| `df.groupby()` | `group_by()` |
| method chaining | pipe (`|>`) |
| `df.reset_index()` | rarely needed |

::: {.callout-tip}
In R, columns are **vectors**, not mini-dataframes.  
This is one of the biggest conceptual differences — and one of R’s strengths.
:::

---

## 4. Mutation: the silent trap for Python users

::: {.tabset group="language"}

### Python

```python
df["x"] = df["x"] * 2
```

This modifies `df` in place.

### R

```r
df |>
  mutate(x = x * 2)
```

This **does not** modify `df` unless you reassign it.

Correct usage:

```r
df <- df |>
  mutate(x = x * 2)
```

:::

::: {.callout-warning}
If you forget to reassign in R, **nothing happens**.  
This is the most common source of “why didn’t my code work?” for Python users.
:::

---

## 5. Loops: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should

::: {.tabset group="language"}

### Python-style thinking (not recommended in R)

```r
for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  df$x[i] <- df$x[i] * 2
}
```

### Idiomatic R

```r
df |>
  mutate(x = x * 2)
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
If you feel the urge to write a `for` loop in R, stop and ask:  
“Is this a vectorized operation?”

In most cases, the answer is **yes**.
:::

---

## 6. Indexing: brackets vs verbs

::: {.tabset group="language"}

### Python

```python
df.iloc[0]
df.loc[df["x"] > 0]
```

### R

```r
df[1, ]
df |>
  filter(x > 0)
```

:::

::: {.callout-note}
Base R indexing exists, but in this course we will prefer tidyverse verbs  
because they are clearer and less error-prone.
:::

---

## 7. Equality, assignment, and naming

- `=` and `<-` both work for assignment  
  (we will use `=` in this course for simplicity)
- `==` is for comparison
- Names are case-sensitive
- Avoid spaces in column names (or use backticks)

---

## 8. Factors: the weird thing you didn’t ask for

R has a special type called `factor` (categorical variable).

Sometimes you will see:

```r
str(df)
```

and a column is a factor when you expected a string.

::: {.callout-note}
For now:
- don’t panic
- use `as.character()` if needed
- we will be explicit about factors when they matter
:::

---

## 9. What you actually need for this course

You do **not** need to become an R expert.

You need to be comfortable with:

- `tibble`
- `filter()`
- `mutate()`
- `summarise()`
- `group_by()`
- pipes (`|>`)

Everything else is secondary.

---

## 10. Final reassurance

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are fluent in Python, you already have the hard skills:
- data thinking
- debugging intuition
- abstraction

R is just a different dialect.
:::

Once the mental model clicks, the rest of the course will feel much lighter.
