This document is **optional**, but strongly recommended.

If you are new to R or come from another language, understanding pipes will make the entire course easier, clearer, and more enjoyable.

## What a pipe really means

In tidyverse-style R, the pipe operator `|>` means:

> “take the result of the previous step and pass it as the input of the next one”

This encourages you to think in terms of **data transformations**, not instructions.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
A good pipeline should read like a sentence describing what happens to the data.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

## Tidyverse code with and without pipes

::: {.tabset group="pipes"}

### Without pipes

```r
df_filtered <- filter(df, value > 0)
df_transformed <- mutate(df_filtered, log_value = log(value))
df_grouped <- group_by(df_transformed, id)
df_summary <- summarise(df_grouped, mean_value = mean(log_value))
```

- Explicit intermediate objects  
- More typing  
- Easier to lose the “story” of the data  

### With pipes

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0) |>
  mutate(log_value = log(value)) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(log_value))
```

- One clear data flow  
- No temporary variables  
- Easier to read, explain, and debug

## The tidyverse mental model

A tidyverse pipeline usually follows this pattern:

- start with a dataset  
- filter rows  
- create or transform variables  
- group the data  
- summarise  

This is not a strict rule, but a very common and effective structure.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Most tidyverse verbs return a **new tibble**.  
The original data is never modified unless you explicitly reassign it.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This mental model is central to the tidyverse philosophy.

## Pipes are not magic

The pipe does **not** change what functions do.  
It only changes **how inputs are passed**.

::: {.tabset group="pipes"}

### Without pipes

```r
summarise(
  group_by(
    mutate(
      filter(df, value > 0),
      log_value = log(value)
    ),
    id
  ),
  mean_value = mean(log_value)
)
```

### With pipes

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0) |>
  mutate(log_value = log(value)) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(log_value))
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If you can rewrite a pipeline as nested function calls,  
then the pipeline is doing exactly what you think it is.
:::

---

## Pipes and column references

Inside tidyverse verbs, column names are used **directly**.

```r
df |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

No `$`, no indexing, no extra syntax.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
This works because tidyverse uses **tidy evaluation**:  
column names are looked up automatically inside the data.
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
You do not need to master tidy evaluation for this course.

## Why we avoid `$` in this course

- It breaks the pipeline mental model  
- It mixes different styles of R  
- It becomes confusing with grouped data  

For clarity and consistency, we will stick to tidyverse verbs and pipelines.

---

## Common pipe mistakes

### Breaking the pipeline

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0)

mutate(log_value = log(value))
```

The second line does not receive the result of the pipeline.

Correct:

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0) |>
  mutate(log_value = log(value))
```

---

### Forgetting reassignment

```r
df |>
  mutate(x = x * 2)
```

Nothing changes.

Correct:

```r
df <- df |>
  mutate(x = x * 2)
```

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
If you forget to reassign, the pipeline runs but the result is discarded.
:::

---

## Pipes and readability

Pipelines are about **clarity**, not cleverness.

Prefer this:

```r
df |>
  filter(value > 0) |>
  group_by(id) |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value))
```

Over this:

```r
df |> filter(value > 0) |> group_by(id) |> summarise(mean_value = mean(value))
```

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
One verb per line is a good default.
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
For more examples of data transformation with `filter()`, `mutate()`,
`group_by()`, and `summarise()`, see

## When not to use pipes

Pipes work best for **linear transformations**.

They are less useful for:

- complex branching logic  
- deeply nested conditionals  
- non–data-centric code  

Even so, in this course we will often prefer pipelines for consistency.

```r
df |>
  summarise(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))
```

---

## Pipes in this course

Throughout the course:

- all data manipulation examples will use pipes  
- tidyverse verbs will be preferred  
- clarity will be valued over clever tricks  

If something feels confusing, read the pipeline **top to bottom**, step by step.

---

## Final takeaway

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If you understand pipes, you understand most of tidyverse-based R.
:::

Everything else in the course builds on this idea.
