This document is **optional**, but strongly recommended.

In forecasting, we do not only analyze observed data.  
We analyze **uncertainty about future values**.

Random variables are the mathematical objects that allow us to make that uncertainty explicit, formal, and usable.

## From data to uncertainty

Suppose you observe a time series:

- daily sales  
- hourly electricity demand  
- monthly inflation  

At time \( t \), the value is known.  
At time \( t+1 \), it is **not**.

That future value is not just “unknown” — it is **uncertain**.

A **random variable** is how we represent that uncertainty mathematically.

::: {.callout-tip}
In forecasting, uncertainty is not a nuisance.  
It is the *object of interest*.
:::

---

## What is a random variable?

Conceptually, a **random variable** represents a quantity whose value is not fixed in advance.

In forecasting, it typically represents:

- a future observation,
- a forecast error,
- or a simulated outcome.

Formally, a random variable is a function

$$
X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R},
$$

which assigns a real number to each possible outcome of an uncertain process.

::: {.callout-note}
You do **not** need to work explicitly with sample spaces or probability axioms in this course.  
The important point is that a random variable is a *mathematical representation of uncertainty*.

## Discrete and continuous random variables

Random variables are commonly classified into two types.

### Discrete random variables

A discrete random variable takes values in a **countable set**.

Examples:

- number of customers tomorrow,
- number of units sold in an hour,
- number of failures in a week.

Uncertainty is described by a **probability mass function** (PMF):

$$
p(x) = \mathbb{P}(X = x),
$$

with the properties

$$
p(x) \ge 0, \qquad \sum_x p(x) = 1.
$$

---

### Continuous random variables

A continuous random variable takes values in a **continuum**.

Examples:

- electricity demand,
- temperature,
- forecast errors.

Uncertainty is described by a **probability density function** (PDF) \( f(x) \), satisfying

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx = 1.
$$

Probabilities are assigned to **intervals**, not points:

$$
\mathbb{P}(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^b f(x)\,dx.
$$

::: {.callout-warning}
For continuous random variables,

$$
\mathbb{P}(X = x) = 0
$$

for any single value \( x \).

This is not a technicality — it is a core conceptual distinction.

## Distributions as models, not data summaries

A **distribution** describes how a random variable behaves.

It answers questions such as:

- Which values are more likely?
- How spread out are the possibilities?
- How extreme outcomes behave?

Crucially:

::: {.callout-important}
A distribution is **not** the same as a histogram.

- A histogram summarizes observed data.
- A distribution is a **model** for uncertainty.
:::

In forecasting, distributions are assumptions — useful, but always assumptions.

---

## Random variables in time series

In time series analysis, we typically work with a sequence of random variables

$$
\{Y_t\}_{t=1}^T.
$$

It is essential to distinguish between:
- \( Y_t \): the random variable,
- \( y_t \): its observed realization.

::: {.callout-tip}
Uppercase letters denote random variables.  
Lowercase letters denote observed values.

This distinction will appear repeatedly throughout the course.
:::

Each future time point corresponds to its **own** random variable.

A forecast is therefore **not a single number**, but a distribution over possible values.

---

## Why this matters for forecasting

Random variables and distributions appear throughout the course, even when not explicitly mentioned:

- forecast distributions and intervals,
- residuals and forecast errors,
- simulation-based forecasting,
- model diagnostics.

Whenever you reason about uncertainty, you are implicitly working with random variables.

::: {.callout-note}
Point forecasts are summaries.  
Distributions carry the full information.
:::

---

## What you do *not* need right now

At this stage, you do **not** need:

- probability axioms,
- manual probability calculations,
- analytical derivations of densities.

Those belong to a probability theory course.

Here, random variables are **tools for thinking**, not objects of proof.

---

## Where this shows up in the course

This refresher prepares you for:

- residual analysis,
- forecast uncertainty and intervals,
- diagnostic checks,
- simulation-based methods.

Later refreshers will build on this foundation to introduce:

- expectation and variance,
- covariance and correlation,
- stationarity and noise.

---

## Takeaway

If you remember only one idea, make it this:

::: {.callout-important}
In forecasting, future values are random variables,  
and models describe their distributions — not certainties.
